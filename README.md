# Tracking Link Generator

A simple web application that allows users to create tracking links. When a user accesses a tracking link, their IP address is displayed on the page. Built using Node.js and Express.

## Project Overview

The Tracking Link Generator is designed to provide users with a straightforward method to generate unique tracking URLs. These links can be shared and used to monitor access, providing the user's IP address when triggered. This application leverages the `nanoid` package to create short, unique IDs for each tracking link.

## Installation

To get started with the Tracking Link Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tracking-link-generator.git
   cd tracking-link-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can install the dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:

   Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can create a tracking link by sending a POST request to `/create-link`. This can be done using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create-link
```

The server will respond with a JSON object containing the generated tracking URL. You can then visit this URL, and it will display the tracking ID and your IP address.

Example response:

```json
{
  "trackingUrl": "http://localhost:8000/track/abc123xyz"
}
```

Visiting the tracking URL will show your IP address.

## Features

- **Link Generation**: Allows users to create unique tracking links.
- **IP Tracking**: Displays the visitor's IP address when the tracking link is accessed.
- **In-memory Storage**: Links are stored temporarily in memory for quick access and can be used within a session.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following packages:

- **express**: ^4.18.2
- **nanoid**: ^4.0.0

You can find them listed in the `package.json` file.
